## How you can help

`qc` is a young project; it's not yet clear how (or if) the project should grow to best support 
its users. Probably the best way to contribute is to use `qc` in your own research, and to share
limitations you discover or new features you wish existed. This 
[repository’s issues page](https://github.com/cproctor/qualitative-coding/issues) would be a great
place to iterate ideas for new features.
