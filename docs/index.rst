`qc`: A tool for qualitative data analysis designed to support computational thinking
=====================================================================================

``qc`` is a free, open-source command-line-based tool for qualitative
data analysis designed to support computational thinking. In addition to
making qualitative data analysis process more efficient, computational
thinking can contribute to the richness of subjective interpretation.
Although numerous powerful software packages exist for qualitative data
analysis, they are generally designed to protect users from complexity
rather than providing affordances for engaging with complexity via
algorithms and data structures.
